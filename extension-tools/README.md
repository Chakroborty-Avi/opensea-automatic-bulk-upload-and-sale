* ### Collection scraper:

This script allows you to scrape the URLs of NFTs from your collection, automatically and quickly. It facilitates the sale of NFTs already uploaded to OpenSea before, without the help of the latter.  

You simply enter the name of your collection - based on the collection URL: `https://opensea.io/collection/crypto-parrot-nfts` ➜ `crypto-parrot-nfts` - and the URLs will be stored in JSON, CSV, and XLSX files that you simply fill in with the other sale details.
